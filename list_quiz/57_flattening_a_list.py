"""
The sum() function in Python typically adds numbers together. 
However, it can also be used more flexibly with its two parameters: 
the first parameter is the iterable you want to sum up, 
and the second parameter is the starting value

Flattening with sum(): 
When you use sum() to flatten a list of lists, 
you pass the list of lists as the first argument and an empty list [] as the second argument. 
What happens is that sum() starts with the empty list 
and then concatenates each sublist in your matrix to this starting list.

# Sixth way: Using Chain function from built-in itertools module
from itertools import chain
print(f"Sixth way output: {list(chain.from_iterable(matrix))}")

"""
Note:
    itertools.chain() can efficiently flatten lists by creating an iterator 
    that yields items from all input iterables, which can be more memory-efficient.
