- Anagram: from a word if we reshuffle those alphabets then it creates a new
            word.
            Example: listen - silent
                     eat = ate


- Builtin methods: Built-in functions are functions provided by Python 
itself (like len() and max()), while methods are functions that belong to a 
specific data type (like str.find() or list.sort()).

- Palindrome: A palindrome is a word, number, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward.
    Example: madam, level

- Armstrong:  a number that equals the sum of its own digits, 
                each raised to the power of the total number 
                of digits in that number, 
                such as 153 (\(1^{3}+5^{3}+3^{3} = 1+125+27 = 153))
